# The Odin Project Knights Travails assignment

This is a solution to the Knight-Travails problem, which aims to find the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard from a given starting position to an ending position.

## Problem Description

Given a chessboard with coordinates representing squares and two points on the board representing the starting and ending positions, the objective is to find the shortest path for a knight to move from the starting square to the ending square.

### Implemented Functions:

- `knightMoves([start], [end])`: Finds the shortest path for the knight to move from the starting square to the ending square.
- Returns the path as a list of coordinates representing squares.

## Example

```javascript
const start = [0, 0];
const end = [3, 3];
console.log('Shortest path:', knightMoves(start, end));
```
